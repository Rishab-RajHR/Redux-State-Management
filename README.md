Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React

It provides a centralized store to manage global state

Uses a predictable data flow: Action → Reducer → Store

Helps avoid prop drilling in large applications

Ensures state changes are traceable and debuggable

Works well with Redux DevTools for debugging

Best suited for large and complex applications

Improves maintainability and scalability

Often used with Redux Toolkit to reduce boilerplate

Ideal when multiple components share frequent state updates
